# fizzbuzz-with-php

Getting started with php and the old classic FizzBuzz

A php script is provided that prints the number 1 to 100 so that:

- If the number is a multiple of 3, "Fizz" is printed instead of that number.
- If the number is a multiple of 5, "Buzz" is printed instead of that number.
- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 (or 15), "FizzBuzz" is printed instead of that number.
